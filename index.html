    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Crispin: I am a data analayst with the mobile game studio <u><a href="https://www.maginteractive.com/">MAG Interactive</a></u> in Stockholm, and I completed my <u><a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/a-polarised-view-on-the-pulses-of-radio-pulsars">PhD on radio pulsar polarisation</a></u> at the University of Manchester. I am passionate about understanding how the world works, and inherently curious about everything! I have particular interest in modelling both physical phenomena and recently, motivated by my work in gaming, human behaviour.

    <h2>What is this website for?</h2>
    <p>I first thought about building my own website during my undergraduate studies, where students were given space in their shared documents to add files allowing them to host very simple static websites. The topic came up again during my PhD, where in academia it is very common for students, postdocs, and colleagues further up the foodchain to have their own webpages, be it for hosting lecture notes, expanding on their publications, or usually to serve as a portfolio.  I made some rather abortive efforts to make my own portfolio website, however I felt stymied by a lack of content. Now though I have a stable job, some free time in the evenings, and some things to write about, so I finally decided to make this one!</p>
